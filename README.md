# TOP-Landing-Page-Project
The Odin Project Landing Page Project

This is the first big project for The Odin Project which occurs at 61% completion of the Foundations Course.

It is the creation of a modern-looking landing page website for some kind of product or service, utisiling only html and css. 

The template that is being worked off, provided by TOP, can be seen here: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

The final product I've made is an attempt at making an exact copy of the template provided. I did not seek to make something unique or individual as I have done so in multiple similar projects after completion of freeCodeCamp courses.

Even though a lot of the positioning is achieved through the use of flexbox, I admit that a large portion of it is "cheesed" to be put into place by usage of margins and padding.. I feel this may be a poor habit in development that needs to be fixed immediately, which would require forcing myself to create basic layout pages and get use to positioning through the repetition. 

Other than that, I am happy with the result as it looks nearly identical to the template.
